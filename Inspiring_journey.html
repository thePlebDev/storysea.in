                        <p>
                            I'm Sourabh Varshney, Final year Computer Science student. Resident of Ujhani, Budaun, UP. I
                            want to share my journey from my turning point, 11th standard. In the beginning of std. 11,
                            I was not aware about JEE. Once, a senior told me that there exists an exam named JEE
                            through which you can have a seat in reputed engineering colleges like IIT ,NIT, etc. So I
                            wished to prepare for it and shared it with my father. He bought 6 books weighing 10 kg from
                            Delhi. In my school, there was no facility of teaching for JEE. Moreover, they were even
                            unable to complete the board syllabus also. I never lost hope and tried my best to crack
                            JEE. I learnt everything from books myself. My school was 13 km away from my home so I used
                            to complete my homework on the school bus itself when other students used to play games. I
                            managed to score 160 marks in Mains and reserved my seat in the chemical branch in SVNIT.

                            <p>
                                Still I was not satisfied with my JEE score as well as my branch. I was aware of the
                                branch change option so I decided to score nice CGPA and along with that I was also
                                preparing for JEE as a backup option. Moreover, I was a technically active fresher, won
                                3 competitions in first year and at night I used to go to Robotics lab for learning.
                                Finally, the first year ended with a lot of memories with my friend circle (the best one
                                I always had). I scored 9.58 CGPA and changed my branch to computer science. Moreover,
                                my JEE score was 220 this year. And this is how I learnt many things from first year. My
                                time management was really tough.
                                Then the second year began. I was part of 4 clubs in college. Drishti, GDG (Google
                                Developer Club), ACM (Association for computer machinery) and Chintan Pratishthan. I
                                started focusing on competitive coding and Machine Learning. I learned a lot from those
                                clubs but I was not able to focus on anything else so I left the clubs in 3rd year and
                                started a new journey.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It was the first day of third year and it was raining like hell. We had our D. E. Shaw
                                coding interview. So, managed to appear in it by walking in about half foot deep water.

                                The questions were pretty straight forward so I solved it in 5 minutes but I was getting
                                segmentation errors in C and was unaware that other programming languages are also
                                allowed. Then, I scored good in aptitude. And complained about the question to Tnp and
                                hackerrank.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                I was selected for the interview. The next day, I had to give a test for
                                another company, JPMC, just before the interview. Because of anxiety, I made a mess of
                                that test. Then, my interview was going average when suddenly the interviewer asked
                                about segmentation fault.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Thinking that I don't have a chance, I told them the issue
                                which was in their question. They were surprised as some students solved it. But, I told
                                them the issue was in C language and nobody solved it in C. So, after a few questions,
                                they let me go. After that, the second round went good too. But, due to the average
                                first round, I was sure that I have left chances for 2 companies in a day. Then, swapnil
                                sir came and told me I was selected. After that, the friends took a cruel gpl. Then,
                                this was a year I only enjoyed. In fourth year after PPO, I decided I should improve the
                                college standard. The motivation was from my friends and we took responsibility for it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I started a mentorship programme for 1st year in which students from 1st year,
                                interested in coding, used to get guidance. This year, I have tried to improve junior's
                                standards in coding in every possible manner.
                                This year, too, was full of night-outs, movies and playing (corridor cricket and cards
                                being the primary).
                                Although things have turned sour due to COVID-19, friendship is the best thing I have
                                found in college and will always remain to be.
                            </p>

                                    life,
                                    to learn (not curriculum, but life skills) but remember stay away from these
                                    cigarettes,
                                    drugs and alcohol. They will destroy your life as well as your family.
                                    Stay away from such seniors who are taking you to such passages.
