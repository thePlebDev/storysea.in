							Everyone keeps saying how important it is to travel. So what’s all this fuss? Why do people
							go and love traveling?

							More importantly: why should we travel more?

							The benefits of traveling are not just a one-time thing: traveling changes you physically
							and psychologically. Having little time or money isn’t a valid excuse. You can fly for cheap
							very quickly. If you have a full-time job and a family, you can still travel on the weekends
							or holidays, even with a baby.

							Here are some of the main benefits of traveling. And I’m sure that once you get started,
							you’ll find some more yourself!

						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The magic thing about home is that it feels good to leave, and it feels even better to
								come back.</p>
						</blockquote>

						<ol>
							<li>
								Traveling Improves Your Health
							</li>
							<p>
								From reducing stress to lower your chances of developing heart disease, the health
								benefits of traveling are huge. You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the
								workplace, including some walking to your trip is sure to make your body feel better.
								For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for depression and anxiety. Of course,
								it’s not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both physically and
								psychologically.

								Traveling more is likely to have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being,
								especially if you’re no used to going out of your comfort zone. Trust me: travel more,
								and your doctor will be happy. Be sure to get in touch with your physician. They might
								recommend some medication to accompany you in your travels, especially if you’re heading
								to regions of the globe with potentially dangerous diseases.

							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Lets You Disconnect From Your Daily Life
							</li>

							<p>
								This point is closely related to my previous point. We tend to get so caught up in our
								daily lives that sometimes, by simply sticking around, we may do ourselves more harm
								than good. Is your boss taking over your life? Are kids driving you mad? Are your
								parents trying to make you live the life they want? How long do you think you can handle
								this pressure before you burst, and everything falls apart?

								Sometimes it is best to take a step back, take a deep breath, and then go that Tower
								Bridge selfie. In all seriousness, travel is not a bad option - it is the most natural
								way of inducing the feeling you miss someone or that you are missed. The trick is to
								leave with a bit of preparation to avoid making a mistake during your journey. Plus, if
								you’re flying, you better start thinking about booking your tickets sooner than later.
							</p>
							<li>
								Traveling Makes You Smarter
							</li>

							<p>
								Get used to picking up new words in a different language every time you travel. You will
								see improvements in your brain capacities. Even more than “just” languages, traveling
								helps you learn about yourself. You might run into challenging situations where you need
								to be resourceful and think differently. I’m sure that you will develop a new set of
								skills that you didn’t suspect you had within you.
							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Improves Your Understanding Of Other Cultures

							</li>

							<p>
								Why we travel may differ from one person to another, but people traveling always develop
								empathy and a deeper understanding of other cultures.

								Being more understanding and tolerant about a culture different than ours is part of
								being smarter. Still, I consider it a benefit of traveling in itself. A quote by Saint
								Augustine goes, “The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page”.
								You could think of it this way: if you read what’s in the news or watch the news on TV
								and don’t question it, you’re missing on a ton of information. You might think that it
								makes you smarter and more aware of the world, but it’s the exact opposite: it narrows
								your mind to a unique and biased perspective.

								Sure, you probably feel comfortable where you are, but that is just a fraction of the
								world! If you are a student, take advantage of programs such as Erasmus to get to know
								more people, experience, and understand their culture. Dare traveling to regions you
								have a skeptical opinion about. I bet that you will change your mind and realize that
								everything is not so wrong abroad.

							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Makes You More Interesting
							</li>

							<p>
								I do not doubt that you’re quite the conversationalist. That being said, including a few
								stories from abroad is likely to grant you even more attention. Mentioning something
								that most people aren’t familiar with or bring a new perspective is always an excellent
								way to shine in a social situation. No need to write a whole travel essay, just discuss
								what you’ve seen and where you’ve been: people who are accustomed to their daily life
								will travel with your words.

								Who do you think people want to listen to the guy who spent his vacations at home doing
								some gardening and reading the newspaper, or the one who spent a week in Cuba, driving
								an old American car, swimming with dolphins and tasting delicious spicy food? I know
								which story I want to hear about...
							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Allows You To Try Amazing Food
							</li>

							<p>
								Speaking of food, I bet you’re one hell of a chef, and your home meals are delicious.
								But there is no such thing as trying a typical local dish from another country. Don’t
								trick yourself into going to the Sushi shop next door: you don’t know what sushi tastes
								like until you’ve been to Japan. As you travel, you discover the real thing and find
								that it’s usually very different from what you’re used to.

								Eating local food in a new country is an entirely new experience. All the flavors are
								different. Hear me out: I’m Rajasthani, and I love our local recipes. You do too. But
								let’s not kid ourselves: some change would be more than welcome in our daily diet. If
								only because we’re naturally curious. Some food bloggers travel thousands of kilometers
								for a specific dish! The least you can do is go to the next region and try something
								new.
							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Makes You Feel Like An Adventurer
							</li>

							<p>
								Even though the world has never been as well connected today, there are still places
								that are little known to the average tourist. Setting up a list of places you want to
								visit is hugely motivating. You have something tangible to go after. I’m currently
								working on my bucket list, and I think I’ll never see the end of it, with all these
								fantastic destinations.

								The benefit of traveling to a new place is that it forces you to face the unknown and
								think differently. You don’t need to spend a month in the jungle! If you live in a large
								city, just going on a hike over the weekend will make you feel different. Adventures
								require novelty, so get out of your comfort zone. It might be scary, but in retrospect,
								you’ll see it as the best decision you ever made!

							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Expands Your (Real) Social Network
							</li>

							<p>
								Believe it or not, social networks were once like a real thing - in real life. Crazy, I
								know. One of the main reasons I love traveling is that establishing connections and
								building a network abroad is one of the smartest things you can do in today’s world. It
								is sometimes hard to make a long-lasting relationship with the people you meet
								elsewhere, but it doesn’t mean it’s not worth meeting new people!
							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Let you Create Lifetime Memories
							</li>

							<p>
								My grandfather was a fantastic story-teller, and he used to tell me stories of the trips
								he made when he was younger. One of my favorites is how he tried to spend one night in
								Bhangarh. He regretted not traveling more as a young man. Years later, he still
								remembered everything in detail: because traveling made a real impression on him. And it
								probably will on you too.

								No matter how insignificant it may seem, the fact that you’ve had an experience abroad,
								something that was out of the ordinary, creates a memory that you will remember for a
								long time.

								I think that creating those memories is why many people keep traveling.

							</p>

							<li>
								Traveling Makes You Love Your Home Even More
							</li>

							<p>
								“The magic thing about home is that it feels good to leave, and it feels even better to
								come back”. You will truly understand the meaning of those words by Wendy Wunder, only
								upon your return home. On the one hand, it would seem that you’re back where you
								started, same setting, same people, same problems. Yet you’re not the same - you’re new,
								full of new knowledge and ideas!

								I know that I was getting bored after living my whole life in the same place. I needed
								to get out, and I need a change of scene. I focused only on the negative: how there
								isn’t much to do around, how you always meet the same people, and how nothing changes.
								Now, when I come home, I’m glad about all of this, and I see only the positive.

							</p>


						</ol>

						<p>
							Final Words On the Benefits of Traveling

							I hope that this travel article makes you want to travel more in 2020. As you go, you
							realize that the world is a much better place than what you can see on TV when watching the
							news.

						</p>

						<p>
							There is a quote by Mark Twain that I love:
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by
								the ones you did do.” Cliché as this may sound, the money you spend on travel is an
								investment in yourself. The trip doesn’t make you feel as bad for spending money.</p>
						</blockquote>
