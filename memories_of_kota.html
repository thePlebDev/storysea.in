                            It was April 30th, 2017, and I entered int the city of Coachings, Kota (Rajasthan). One of
                            my school friends, Ankit, was with me. I was very excited about the dazzling of Kota city
                            and a bit worried about my further days in Kota.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, first, let me tell you about my life before coming to Kota. I studied up to 10th class
                            in a small town of Nagaur (Rajasthan). Then I went to Sikar (Another district of Rajasthan)
                            to further my 11th and 12th class studies. There are a lot of memories of Sikar, but I'll
                            share those on some other day. In short, I passed 12th class with 3rd rank and awarded with
                            the silver medal in RBSE(Rajasthan Board).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I was telling you about my life at Kota. I, with my friend Ankit joined Resonance
                            Institute and took a hostel on rent for one year. I don't know why, but my sleeping time
                            increased drastically initially. But I controlled it, and it took 20-25 days to abandon this
                            sleeping schedule and manage a new one. Later some of my school friends also took the train
                            to Kota and joined Resonance. We together visited different places at Kota like Seven
                            Wonders, City Mall (which is well known in Kota) etc many times. But the time when we
                            realised the real struggle of JEE preparation was our first test. We all did satisfactorily
                            work in our first test and got reshuffled to our phase's top batch. My schoolmates were also
                            with me. Soon, I realised the speed of the course completion. We hardly used to save time to
                            look back. However, we had to manage our time for a short revision by discussing doubts with
                            each other.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After 4–5 months, life showed us many changes from our school. Those days, I was far from
                            home and used to miss my house a lot. A lot of memories of my school life and home used to
                            work as a catalyst for my emotions. Many times, A couple of tears used to behave as
                            uninvited guests at a party.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In December - January, some suicide cases happened, and we feel the harsh reality behind the
                            dazzling of this city. Once I was afraid and couldn't sleep until 4 o'clock because of a
                            suicide near my hostel. This accident forced me to think deeply. Sometimes we used to
                            discuss such topics in the house. Ankit was a homesick person and ofter fell ill. I used to
                            take him to the hospital. I found there that many students become careless towards their
                            health during their JEE time. Our syllabus completed on March 1st, and our classes ended.
                            JEE mains was going to held on April 8th. Almost all of my coaching friends were in my
                            contact. There was a bit misunderstanding between me and one of my batchmates, Abhishek, so
                            we rarely used to talk to each other. But now it's alright, and we are good friends.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yes, our tests used to be in every two weeks, so we all were in contact with each other. We
                            used to talk about our preparation during lunch and dinner. Ankit was at my hostel.
                            Sometimes Ankit and I used to talk late at night on any unpractical topics, and the next day
                            we used to regret that we had wasted much time on the previous night. In those days of
                            preparation, I hardly came out of my room the whole day. Sometimes I used to talk with my
                            juniors of my hostels, and they used to ask me about the tips to study and some doubts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before ten days of JEE mains, I completed all of my revision and was chill about the exam,
                            but one day later, I was again surrounded by tension. I consulted with KJ Sir (Our maths
                            teacher). He suggested me not to solve tougher questions and be motivated every time. On
                            April 6th, I returned home for jee mains.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My jee mains got over, and I came back to Kota for JEE Advanced. Revision class had begun,
                            and All of us were again busy in solving DPPs and books. Many of my friends were returning
                            to their homes. Before ten days to jee adv, Ankit and I were the only in our friend-circle
                            who were still in this enchanted city. Before two days of jee adv, we both said goodbye to
                            Kota and returned to our homes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But The one thing that Kota city taught me how to struggle with problems by living far from
                            home and introduces me to my capabilities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now I'm in IIT Delhi. I didn't meet again with many of my coaching friends yet. But I still
                            miss all of them and the days we spent together at Kota. I still miss my coaching classes,
                            my teachers, the food of mess(not too bad) and late-night study, the way from my hostel to
                            coaching, roaming around city mall, my classmates, Kachori and Pohe of that city,
                            world-famous Dussehra Fair, fun with friends, Holi and birthday celebration in the hostel,
                            extra classes of KJ sir, the excitement of the result in our coaching tests and most
                            importantly, the atmosphere of Kota where JEE is in the air.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are a lot of memories of Kota. I can't share all of these here.
                            <br>
